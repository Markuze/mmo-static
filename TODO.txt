1. Fix get struct
	a. rm vmlinux untill all is working
	b. add cscope use.
2. debug recursion



# Mapping type: high risk, direct, .
#.
#indirect.
# Direct:
# Alloc, definition local.
# Function call ...
#
# 0.1 : Annon structs (adapter_t)
# 0.2 : Pahole -i <class> - when mapped structed is in a bigger struct.
# 2.  : determine assignment : slub, heap, struct.
# 2.1 : switch variable in assignment.
# 3   : Function pointers.
# 4.  : Validate results
# 6.  : map_page? map_sg?

# 5.  : build_skb - Auto High Risk! (validate with dma_unmap?)

#consider hacking slub (https://lwn.net/Articles/229984/) to force mapping specific addresses.

#####################
1. Fix recursion on assignment... add a stop clause :)
2. Handle case when pahole doesnt find (definition in diff file - use cscope)
3. Handle typedef
4. Handle define differently.
5. Handle callback ptrs
6. Review Warnings/Errors
7. Review Long stacks
##########################3
## Define Algo  for Match:Field.
use cases:

1. Handle only one layer of ->
2. Any . are irrelevant as parent field is mapped ? unless is ptr. -- Follow till call

### ALgo:
#1. Find defenition
#	if ptr stop when alloc found.
#	if local - forget fielD. - look for assignment: recurse.
#	if direct - look for assignment : recurse
#2. Find assignment. - recurse:

1. Find Defenition : no recurse: Find biggest mapped struct.
2. Search for assignment to biggest struct - has Field name: recurse.
