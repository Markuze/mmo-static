# Mapping type: high risk, direct, indirect.
# Direct:
# Alloc, definition local.
# Function call ...
#
# 0   : Handle case of $CURR_FUNC == void
# 0.1 : Annon structs (adapter_t)
# 0.2 : Pahole -i <class> - when mapped structed is in a bigger struct.
# 2.  : determine assignment : slub, heap, struct.
# 2.1 : switch variable in assignment.
# 3.  : skbs (build skb)
# 4.  : Validate results

#consider hacking slub (https://lwn.net/Articles/229984/) to force mapping specific addresses.
