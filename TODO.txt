# Mapping type: high risk, direct, indirect.
# Direct:
# Alloc, definition local.
# Function call ...
#
# 0. High risk : done -
# 0.1 : Annon structs (adapter_t)
# 0.2 : Pahole -i <class> - when mapped structed is in a bigger struct.
# 1. Direct, Alloc
# 2. Direct, Func call


#consider hacking slub (https://lwn.net/Articles/229984/) to force mapping specific addresses.
